# COMP1406

In this repository, I've included any projects, scripts or assignments I've done throughout the term. 

Some projects cannot be publicly shared as they use boilerplate code from the course; you'll notice a fair amount of links that go to GitLab and are private. Sorry, can't do anything to fix that.
